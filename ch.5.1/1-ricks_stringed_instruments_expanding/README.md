## Third Step: Strive for a maintainable, reusable design
Now, you need to add new property to GuitarSpec. So you need to change
a lot of places on your code, you need to change in Guitar class
and Inventory class. you shouldn't have to change code in Guitar and Invernotry to add
a new property to the GuitarSpec class.

You need to encapsulate the guitar specification and isolate them from the rest
of Rick's guitar search tool.

The good design is when you haven't to change on more places
to app work. So you want more encapsulation to make you'r code better
and easy to grow.
